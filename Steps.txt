    - Scaling
    - Further analysis on data (Darshil)

3) Model Design and prototype development
     - RNN (David)

     - Transformers (Rizvan and Darshil)

4) Literature Review
     - Summarize 2 related works to provide context and justification for your approach. (David)
     - Provide insights into potential challenges in data handling, such as missing values, class
       imbalances, or scalability issues. (Rizvan and Darshil)


5) Testing and Analysis  (Navpreet)
      - Identify the key evaluation metrics
